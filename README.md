# Hasan's Snake Game

A modern twist on the classic Snake Game, Hasan's Snake Game includes unique obstacles that form the name "Hasan's Snake üêç" within the game grid. This project demonstrates JavaScript skills with a focus on DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game development concepts.

## Features

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Control the snake using **W, A, S, D** keys and aim to consume food that randomly appears on the grid.
- **Obstacles**: Unique obstacles form the title of the game within the grid, adding an extra challenge.
- **Score Tracking**: Track your progress with an updated score displayed at the top of the game board.
- **Game Over Message**: If you collide with obstacles, walls, or yourself, the game ends and displays a message.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Press the **SPACE** key to start.
2. **Controls**: Use the following keys to control the snake:
   - **W**: Move up
   - **S**: Move down
   - **A**: Move left
   - **D**: Move right
3. **Objective**: Eat as much food as possible to increase your score while avoiding walls, obstacles, and the snake‚Äôs own tail.
4. **Game Over**: If the snake collides with an obstacle, wall, or itself, the game will end, and you can restart by pressing **SPACE** again.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hasan-snake-game.git

3. **Open `index.html` in a Browser**: Simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it with a web browser.

## Technologies Used
